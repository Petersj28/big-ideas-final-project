    " ## Introduction\n",
    "Defining the \"best\" neighborhood in Pittsburgh is a very subjective process. To help eliminate some of the human bias, an analytical approach can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used three sub-metrics to help determine this, quality of life, assaults, and housing-economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we needed various data sets:\n",
    "* Quality of Life: Neighborhoods with SNAP data\n",
    "* Assaults: 911 EMS Dispatches and Population by Municipality\n",
    "* Housing-Economics:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Best Neighborhood\n",
    "McKeesport - To be determiend\n",
    "Regent Square: A high QOL score, great economics for housing, and average assault rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "* Jack Carluccio - Given that I do not live in Pittsburgh, I do not have a solid opinion on the best neighborhood. However, I would pick downtown Pittsburgh, because I love the city. Although, my metric of quality of life would directly punish downtown, because it uses population density as a bad metric.\"\n",
    "* Jack Peters - I would pick Licoln Place to be the best neighborhood because it performs well in our quality of life metric, has a good median home value, and only averages 5 assault dispatches per 1,000 people per year which is very good for a neighborhood with a medium sized population near to the bulk of Pittsburgh."
